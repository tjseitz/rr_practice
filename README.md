# How to fold a paper airplane: Nakamura Lock


## What you need
* A single piece of 8.5" x 11" printer paper
* Ruler
* Pencil or pen

## Instructions
1. Fold your paper in half, length-wise into a 4.25" x 11" rectangle
2. Sharply crease the fold while making sure that the edges line up
3. Unfold the paper to lay it flat and vertical on the surface in front of you
4. Take the top two corners and draw them towards you to fold down into a pointy triangle, lining up the top edges of the paper with the center crease
5. Sharply crease the triangle shape you just created at the top
6. Take the top point and draw it towards you down to the center crease of the paper, and crease the paper where the bottom edge of the triangle is folded over

**You should now have a square (approximately) with a triangle, point facing downward, folded on top**

7. Taking your ruler, line it up along the center crease and measure 2" and 1.5" straight up from the bottom point of the folded-down triangle, make a mark at each measurement with your pen on the center crease
8. Move your ruler parallel to the top edge of the square, and with your pen, mark a 2.5" long line centered over the center crease of the paper
9. Taking the point of the downward-facing triangle, bring only the tip upwards until it reaches the 2" mark on the center crease
10. Crease the bottom of the mini triangle you just created, with the point towards the top of the paper
11. Unfold the mini triangle
12. To make the right wing, take the right top edge of the newly folded square and bring down toward the 1.5" mark on the center crease
13. As you bring the corner of the flap down, make sure the top of the crease starts at the right end of the 2.5" line across the top of the page
14. Sharply crease this wing, careful of where the point and the top corner line up
15. Repeat steps 12-14 with the left side
16. Now refold the mini triangle that you creased at step 10 upwards to the 2" mark 

**You should now have a roughly pointy shape with a flat top**

17. Flip the airplane over, so the folded underside is resting on the surface infront of you
18. Take the right edge of the plane and bring towards you, folding the plane in half on the original center crease, the underside of the right wing should be visible
19. To make the right wing, fold the right wing down parallel to the center crease
20. Crease the wing about .75" away from the center crease, if done correctly, the folded top edges of the "point" should line up
21. Flip the plane over so underside of the left wing is now facing upwards, and repeat steps 19 and 20 being careful that the plane is symmetrical
22. Pop the wings out so they are perpendicular to the "body" of the plane
23. You have the option of adding wingtips to the edge of each wing
24. Take your plane out for a fly!
